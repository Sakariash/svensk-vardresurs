# Code Review

Code review written by [Sofia RÃ¶nnkvist](https://github.com/sofiaronnkvist).

1. `General:root` - Your index.php file should be avaliable in the root of the project.
2. `main.css:111-114` - On smaller screens, this paragraph needs more space since it overflows now.
3. `navbar.css` - When the screen is in tablet/mobile size, the hamburger menu should be able to drop down with the options.
4. `General:images` - The alternative texts for the pictures needs some work to be more descriptive.
5. `index.php:25` - Consider adding \* or some text to singnal that all fields must be chosen before clicking Skicka for it to work.
